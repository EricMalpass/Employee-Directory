# Employee-Directory

Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the Random User API, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:


Sort the table by at least one category


Filter the users by at least one property.


Side note: Currently you can only filter and not sort and the CSS has not been finished.
